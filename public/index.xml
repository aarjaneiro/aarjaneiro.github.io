      <description>Hello World! I am beginning to build this website which I hope will become a place where I can share my thoughts on quantitative finance, open source software, and other topics that interest me. Moreover, I hope to use this website as a place to share some of my own projects and developments.
I currently am a Quantitative Analyst at VirgoCX, a cryptocurrency exchange based in Toronto, Canada. My work is mainly in market making, algorithmic trading, and quantitative research.</description>
