      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am &lt;strong&gt;Aaron Janeiro Stone&lt;/strong&gt;, an Intermediate Software Engineer at Alpaca.&#xA;I am building this website as a place to share my thoughts on quantitative finance, open source software, and other topics that interest me.&#xA;Moreover, I hope to use this space to share some of my own projects and developments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At VirgoCX, my work as a Quantitative Analyst mainly concerned market making, algorithmic trading, and quantitative research. Specifically, work has mainly revolved around the&#xA;development and deployment of a new market making engine, programmed in Python, Cython, and C++.&#xA;I also developed an anomaly detection framework built upon models trained using TensorFlow (using transfer learning to allow us to generalize an &amp;ldquo;index&amp;rdquo; model to new trading pairs).&#xA;Previously, I also worked at QuantConnect as a Software Engineering Intern where I developed a time series submodule for the LEAN algorithmic trading engine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
